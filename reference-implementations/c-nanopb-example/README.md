# First Mile Protocol - nanopb C Example

This is a simple demonstration of how to use the [nanopb](https://jpa.kapsi.fi/nanopb/) library to encode Protocol Buffer messages for the First Mile communications protocol. The nanopb library is specifically designed for embedded devices and microcontrollers with limited resources.

## Overview

This demo creates a single Data message containing one observation with:
- Parameter definition ID: 1
- Current timestamp
- Two values: a float value (23.5) and an empty value

The encoded protobuf message is output as hexadecimal characters to stdout.

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./firstmile_demo
```

## Output

The program will output the encoded protobuf message as a hexadecimal string.

## Code structure

### nanopb Library
The code in the `nanopb/` subdirectory is imported (copy-pasted) from the nanopb project.

### Schema Files
The compiled First Mile schema files (`firstmile.pb.c` and `firstmile.pb.h`) were generated using the nanopb protoc compiler from the  `firstmile.proto` file.

The dependent Google protobuf schemas (`empty.pb.*` and `timestamp.pb.*`) were taken from the "full" Protocol Buffers implementation, (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf), and then compiled with the nanopb compiler.
